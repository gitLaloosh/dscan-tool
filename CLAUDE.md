# Notes for AI assistants working on this repo

EVE Threat Assessment (ETA; called D-Scan Analyzer until v2026.10.14.60, and the repo, file and
saved-data names still say dscan) is a single-file tool (`index.html`) that estimates EVE Online
ship stats from killmails and EFT fits. Its calculations must match **pyfa**
exactly, using primary sources only: pyfa's source code and CCP's SDE / live ESI.

Before any calculation work, check that pyfa hasn't moved:
`PYFA_SRC=/path/to/Pyfa python3 -I tools/pyfa_update_check.py` (add `--run` for
the full verification chain). See `PYFA_CORE.md`.

**The rule (`PYFA_CORE.md`):** code fenced `PYFA CORE BEGIN/END` in `index.html`
replicates pyfa and is fingerprint-locked (`tools/pyfa_core_manifest.json`). The
tool may change what goes INTO the pyfa calculation (module states, assumed
charges, drones) or how results are SHOWN, never how the calculation works.
Change a core section only to match pyfa, then re-verify and run
`node tools/check_pyfa_core.mjs --update`. Every deliberate difference from pyfa
is listed in `DEVIATIONS.md`; an unlisted difference is a bug.

Before changing any calculation:

1. Read `LESSONS_LEARNED.md`, the catalog of mistakes already made here.
   Follow its checklist **in order**: it's the definition of done, and the
   expected values are derived before any code is written.
2. Use `tools/` (see `tools/README.md`):
   - `tools/pyfa_effects.py` runs pyfa's real effect handlers so you find all
     of them. Don't grep or regex `effects.py`.
   - `tools/independent_checks/` derives expected values without the tool's
     own tables. `tools/pyfa_fit_oracle.py` runs pyfa's handlers on a whole
     fit (hull, modules, charges, skills, mode) and is the reference for
     resistances; reuse it for any stat it covers.
3. Run `node regression_suite/run_regression.mjs index.html`. It must print
   ALL PASS. Add a constructed golden fit for every new mechanism.
4. Bump the version tag in `header.hero` (`vYYYY.MM.DD.N`). Add a dated note
   to `dscan-tool-history/`.

**Error messages carry codes** (`ERRORS.md`). Every error the page writes ends
with a code such as `(ZKB-01)`, defined once in `ERROR_CODES` in `index.html`
(what triggers it, what to check, why it exists, the build and history doc).
A new error message gets a new code there (never reuse or renumber one; retire
it instead), shown with `withCode()` / `codedError()`. Then run
`python3 -I tools/gen_errors_md.py --write`. Owner reports quote the code: look it up in
`ERRORS.md` first.

**My Ship** (v2026.10.14.33, `roadmap/my-ship-plan.md`): the user's own fit, saved in
the browser (`localStorage` `dscanMyShip`: EFT text, module states, the switch; never the
numbers, which are recomputed from the text). Code: the `MY SHIP` block at the end of the
script; classes `mys-*` (`ms-*` means module state). Start-up code must survive the suites'
stub DOM (LESSON #36). Check: `tools/page_checks/my_ship_check.py`.

When you find a new kind of mistake, add it to `LESSONS_LEARNED.md` and give
the history doc a "Lesson for future models" section. In code, mark the site
with a `// LESSON #n` comment that points at the entry.

**How the numbers are worked out, for people:** `METHODOLOGY.md` (was the "How effective HP and DPS are
calculated" note on the page, removed in v2026.10.14.51); each card's short version is its ⓘ panel (`CARD_INFO`).
Change both when a calculation's assumptions change.

**After finishing any task,** check `todo-inbox/` for new requests the
owner wrote down while you were working: `new-bugs.txt` and
`new-backlog-items.txt`. If either file has entries, add each one to the bug
list or the backlog, then remove those entries from the text file and tell the
owner what you added. If both are empty, say nothing about it.
